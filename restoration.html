				<p>Our book restorer and fine binder is Nick Smith who trained under Arthur Johnson at the London College Bridge of Printing. He is a fellow and past president of the institute of Bookbinding and Allied Trades (IBAT) with over 30 years experience.</p>
				<p>A typical restoration will include re-stitching, reparing corners, replacing the linings and refitting the original spine if still in existence, to match the original book as closely as possible.

				<p>Every repair is different therefore it is essential that we see the condition of the book before we can evaluate the work required. This way we can give the best advice and discuss with you the various options available based on your requirements.</p>
