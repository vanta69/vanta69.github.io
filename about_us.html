				<h2>About Us</h2> 		
				<p>Julia Appleby is an old librarian, innovative, feminist hat maker, legendary book buyer, seller and refurbished. She has owned an old bookshop and situated in Colombo street Christchurch since 2001. She sells old books that are not being published anymore, restores old books and offers appraisals.</p>
				<p>I love the smell of old books, the tattered spines, the frayed yellow pages, and the unspoken memories that are caught within the fading words. I love the inscriptions within these books, names, dates, sometimes dedications, and imagining what they meant to someone at some point. It is so beautiful to connect with people who have read and hopefully loved this book before, irrespective of age, culture, and maybe country and race.</p>

					<h2>Our Team</h2>
            
					<p>The old bookshop is operated by Julia Appleby and her part-time assistant, Miranda Smith. Miranda has started working in the bookshop since she was 16. Reading books has always been a passion of hers, and by working at Ye Olde Bookshop, she gets to surround myself with books every day! She deals with exciting things like accounts and paperwork, plus the buying and selling of old books.</p>
					<p>Our team is at your disposal to advise you and help you find the book you are looking for.</P>
