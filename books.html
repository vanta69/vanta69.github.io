					<p> Books do not need be antiques to be collectable. Books come in all shapes and sizes and maintain value whether rare, antique, contemporary, fiction, non-fiction, comic, art, children or illustrated. Vintage book values stem from their rarity, physical condition, and literary importance. When considering the value of rare book like a Shakespearean folio found tucked away in the corner of your favorite bookstore or a first edition of The Da Vinci Code, our specialist is able to provide an accurate online valuation based on a number of qualifying factors.</p>
					<p>The condition of any book can determine its value; it is always wise to be aware of any foxing or staining that may exist on the inside of a book, broken spines or torn or missing pages before sending in your book for valuation. Signatures and dedications do increase the value of the book so make sure to these conditions to our experts. We've been able to value a wide variety of books, ranging from 17th Century leather bound books to modern day publications such as Harry Potter first edition soft covers which sell for over $200,000.</p>
